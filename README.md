Welcome to My Dashboard Project!

This Admin Dashboard project is a layout exercise aimed at improving my HTML and CSS grid layout skills. This project focuses solely on the visual aspects.

### Built With
* HTML
* CSS
* Other tools used:
  
  * Github Pages for free hosting
  * Git for version control

  * Visual Studio Code for IDE

### Motivation
To practice and refine my HTML and CSS fundamentals, specifically grid layouts

### My Learnings
* Value of CSS Grid for layouts
* Value of CSS functions
* Value of SASS. It's nesting feature is great for readability and reducing repetition
* Value of Chrome DevTools, especially for layout debugging and visualizing grid lines
* Value of dynamic width/height for responsiveness
* Usefulness of other CSS selectors, i.e. child combinator and pseudo-class selector
* Importance of naming elements properly. Started to apply BEM naming convention in this project
* Importance of a CSS reset

### Known Issues
* Not mobile responsive. Only responsive with various desktop screen sizes
